### CS248 Computer Graphics course
My homework assignments for CS248 Computer Graphics course at KAUST 2020 Fall.


Additional features we have:
- all 4 object types: sphere, ellipsoid, cone and plane.
- specular lighting (i.e. Blinn-Phong shading model instead of just Lambertian)
- multiple light sources
- key controls:
    - to switch between controls
    - to switch between number of light sources
- render everything "online" (instead of saving to an image)
- multiple objects
- unit tests
- finite cone instead of infinite cone
- much higher resolution
- ok fps for 800x600

### TODO
- Cone
- profiling and specify hardware
- write a report
