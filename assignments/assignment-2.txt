Assignment 2: Modeling and Viewing Transformations

(Minimal requirements are a guideline for succeeding to obtain 80% points. You are strongly encouraged to engage yourself with the assignment and implement features that are beyond this feature set by at least 20% to score the maximum points. However extra features do not mean that you do not need to implement one or the other minimum requirement aspect, those should be a subset of your assignment solution. On the student presentation, you should highlight the extra 20% of your assignment solution as this will likely differentiate you with the rest of the class.)

The first task, if you have not done so, display the ray traced output on the screen instead of storing it into the image file.

The second task will be object selection via mouse (and left mouse button click) or at least cursor picking (move a cursor with WASD keys and press space to select object).

Implement simple camera controls:
- pan camera horizontally and vertically (panning means moving the camera perpendicular to the direction it is pointed)
- rotate camera around the scene from equal distance (horizontally and vertically)
- reset camera to the default position
- the camera interaction can be done using mouse and/or keyboard and/or user interface (ImGui, ...)

Once the object is selected:
- move it in a view-aligned plane (a plane parallel to the viewing plane) up, down, top, and bottom.
- rotate it around its own center point in all three world coordinate axes (the center point of the object remains in the same position)
- scale it (center point of the object remains in the same position)
- reset transformations
- hint: for basic manupulation with the selected object you can integrate ImGuizmo (https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo)

Example of additional options beyond 80%:
- implement visual controls for object modeling transformation
- perform zooming operation
- make the scene dynamic where either camera flies a certain path or the scene objects are animated (eg. implement simple physics)
- modify the position of the light source
